// A simple killâ€‘switch implementation for C++.
//
// The kill switch allows any process in the system to be put into a
// "tripped" state. When the switch is tripped all entry points must
// refuse to do work. This header declares a tiny API used by other
// components to query and manipulate the switch.

// considered tripped if the environment variable `COCKPIT_EVOLVE` is set
// to `off`, or if a sentinel file exists on disk.  The sentinel file
// defaults to `KILL_SWITCH` but can be overridden via the
// `KILL_SWITCH_PATH` environment variable.
